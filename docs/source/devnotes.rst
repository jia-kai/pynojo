Notes for Developers
====================

.. contents::

Contact Kai Jia <jia.kai66@gmail.com> if you have any question about this page.


Getting Started
---------------


Environment Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Install SQLite3 and its development packages if you don't already
    have them installed.  Usually this is via your system's package
    manager.  For example, on a Debian Linux system, do ``sudo apt-get
    install libsqlite3-dev``.

#.  Install virtualenv:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ sudo pip install virtualenv

#.  Setup a workplace using virtualenv. Note that you may need to specify **-p
    python2** option to tell virtualenv to use Python 2. Replace
    <path-to-your-workplace> with something you like:

    .. code-block:: sh
        
        $ virtualenv <path-to-your-workplace>

#.  Write your own init.sh (note that it has already been added to
    *.gitignore*):

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>
        $ echo 'export PATH=<path-to-your-workplace>/bin:$PATH' > init.sh
        $ . ./init.sh


    **Note:** the following steps assume that you have put *init.sh* at the right
    place and have executed ``. ./init.sh``.

#.  Use pip to get the dependencies installed:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ pip install pyramid sqlalchemy python-cjson   # runtime dependencies
        $ pip install sphinx pyenchant babel \
            sphinxcontrib-spelling pylint               # development dependencies

#.  Generate the .mo files and documents, which are not tracked by the version
    control system (see also :ref:`devnotes-nls` and
    :ref:`devnotes-documenting`):

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/utils/nls
        $ ./genmo
        $ cd ../../docs
        $ ./gendoc


#.  Download all the 3rd party utils according to *utils/3rd-party/list*:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/utils/3rd-party
        $ ./download-all.sh


#.  Generate the CSS and javascript files (see also :ref:`devnotes-css-js`):

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/utils
        $ ./gencss
        $ ./genjs

.. _devnotes-sysconf:

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The static system configuration package is :mod:`pynojo.config`. To allow the
developers applying their local settings without having to change the system
defaults, *pynojo/config/overwrite.py* has been added to *.gitignore*. Define a
function named *overwrite* in that file and change the configuration there. 

An example file::

    # pylint: disable=C0111,R0201
    from pynojo.config.db import DBConfig

    _engine = None
    _DBFILE = '/tmp/pynojo.db'
    # _DBFILE = ':memory:'

    class MyDB(DBConfig):
        @staticmethod
        def make_session():
            global _engine
            from sqlalchemy import create_engine, event
            from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, scoped_session
            engine = create_engine('sqlite:///' + _DBFILE)
            event.listen(engine, 'connect', lambda con, record:
                    con.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON'))
            ses = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind = engine))
            _engine = engine
            return ses

    def _init():
        import logging
        class SQLFilter(logging.Filter):
            def filter(self, record):
                record.name = 'SQL'
                return True

        logging.basicConfig(
                filename = '/tmp/pynojo.log',
                format = '%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(message)s',
                datefmt = '%H:%M:%S'
                )
        logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine').setLevel(logging.INFO)
        logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine').addFilter(SQLFilter())


    def overwrite(conf):
        _init()
        from os.path import isfile
        db_exists = isfile(_DBFILE)

        conf.pyramid.SETTINGS['reload_templates'] = True
        conf.db = MyDB()

        # install_db must be imported after conf.db is set
        from pynojo.model import install_db
        if not db_exists:
            install_db(_engine)



Miscellaneous Specifications and Instructions
---------------------------------------------

Framework
^^^^^^^^^

`Pyramid`_ is used as the web framework, and `SQLAlchemy`_ as the ORM. Note that
pynojo uses a subclass of :class:`pyramid.request.Request` as the request
factory; see :class:`pynojo.__init__.Request`.


Code Style
^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the `Style Guide for Python Code`_.  Use `pylint`_ to check the style and
find potential bugs. Execute the *run-pylint* script to invoke pylint.

The following lines should be included in every Python source file::

    # $File: <file name>
    # $Date: <last modification time>
    #
    # Copyright (C) 2012 the pynojo development team <see AUTHORS file>

    #

Configure your editor to update the *$File* and *$Date* fields automatically.
Add your name to the contributors field and the AUTHORS file.

By the way, if vim is your favorite, you can add the following lines to
your vimrc:

.. code-block:: vim

    autocmd filetype python set expandtab
    autocmd filetype python set textwidth=79


.. _devnotes-documenting:

Documenting
^^^^^^^^^^^

Write docstrings for every package, module, public class, public method, public
function, etc. The documents should be written in English.

Register all the global names in :ref:`global-name-list`.

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText`_ sources and docstrings by
`Sphinx`_.  Issue the following command to generate all the documents:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/docs
    $ ./gendoc


If environment variable *PYNOJO_DOC_SPELLCHECK* exists, then
*sphinxcontrib.spelling* will be used for spell-checking of all the documents.
The extra word list file is located at *docs/wordlist.txt*.


Threading
^^^^^^^^^

Although current CPython implementation does not fully support multithreading,
keep in mind that all the code should be **thread-safe**, so be careful when
modifying global variables. 

To avoid confusion, unexpected behavior or overuse of resource (exceeding the
thread limit in the server configuration), do not use multithreading unless
absolutely necessary.

If it is really necessary to spawn a child thread, remember to call
:func:`pynojo.lib.register_thread_request` in the child thread to ensure that
functions depending on :func:`pynojo.lib.get_thread_request` work correctly.



.. _devnotes-nls:

Native Language Support (NLS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the human-readable messages in pynojo python source code and templates should
be written in English. There should NOT be any non-ASCII characters in the
source, except in nls/config.py, where TRANS_LIST describes the available
translations.

pynojo dose not use the NLS mechanism provided by Pyramid and Chameleon.
Instead, pynojo has its own :mod:`pynojo.nls` package, which is based on
`GNU gettext`_.  To generate the pot file, cd to *utils/nls* and execute
*./genpot*.  The pot file will be stored in the current directory. The locale
directory is pynojo/nls/locale. To update the po files or generate the mo files,
cd to *utils/nls* and execute *./update-po* or *./genmo* respectively.

To localize:

    * In a pyramid view callable, the *request* parameter passed to it will
      include the translation functions as methods named *_* and *_pl*. They are
      appropriate for the locale of the client, which is already determined
      according to the information provided by *request*.
    * *_* and *_pl* are also added to the *__builtin__* namespace, so they can
      be invoked directly. This method is slightly slower than the one above,
      for it has to access thread local variable. It is assumed that the caller
      resides in the same thread as that of the pyramid view callable, otherwise
      :func:`pynojo.lib.register_thread_request` has to be called explicitly
      before calling *_* or *_pl*.
    * In a page template, the appropriate translation functions are the global
      functions named *_* and *_pl*.
    * See :func:`pynojo.nls.init` and :mod:`pynojo.view` for some further
      explanations.
    
To add a new translation, use *msginit* to generate the po file from the pot
file. Move the output po file to pynojo/nls/locale/*<lang>*/LC_MESSAGES/pynojo.po
and **append** corresponding :class:`pynojo.nls.config.TransInfo` instance to
*TRANS_LIST* defined in pynojo/nls/config.py. DO NOT change the order of the
translations already listed there.

Here are two examples:

In a pyramid view callable::

    @view_config(route_name = mkroute(pattern = ''), renderer = 'template/index.pt')
    def _index(request):
        return {'msg': request._('msgfrompython') + _('builtin-trans')}

In a page template:

.. code-block:: html

    <div metal:use-macro="layout">
        <div metal:fill-slot="content">
            ${_('{0}from{t}', 'msg', t = 'template')} <br />
            ${msg} <br />
            ${_pl('singular', 'plural', 1)} <br />
            ${_pl('singular', 'plural', 2)} <br />
        </div>
    </div>


Locale detection details:

    * If the user does not login, detect the locale via Accept-Language field in
      the HTTP request header.
    * Cookie: TODO




.. _devnotes-css-js:

Stylesheets and Javascripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pynojo uses `closure-stylesheets`_ to minify the stylesheets. Put all the GSS
files in *pynojo/view/static/gss/*, and generate the all-in-one CSS file using
the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/utils
    $ ./gencss

`UglifyJS`_ is used to minify the javascripts. Note that you have to get
`nodejs`_ installed. Put all the scripts in *pynojo/view/static/gss/*, and
generate the all-in-one js file by:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd <path-to-pynojo-source-root>/utils
    $ ./genjs
