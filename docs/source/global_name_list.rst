Global Name List
================

The global names that are not documented in the API Reference should be listed
here.

.. contents::


Database Session
----------------

A contextual session defined in :mod:`pynojo.model` is used. To create
a session instance ``ses`` in some function, just do the following::

    from pynojo.model import Session

    def foo():
        ses = Session()
        # do something with ses

Direct invoking of :meth:`Session.commit` is usually unnecessary, except when
some operations that might fail and call :meth:`Session.rollback` are performed,
in which case :meth:`Session.commit` should be called before starting any of
those operations. The committing is performed in a subscriber defined in
:mod:`pynojo.model`.


Renderers
---------

The following renderers are provided by pynojo (see the source of
:mod:`pynojo.view`):

    * cjson: replace the json renderer, to gain some efficiency.
